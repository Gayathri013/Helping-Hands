see many physically handicapped persons facing lots of problems in society and they depend 
on their parents or relatives for their needs. It is even difficult to their parents because being 
available to them all the time is not an easy task as they have their own responsibilities and 
occupations.
Besides, there are some people mainly youth who are not yet graduated, graduated but not 
employed want to do a part time job to earn their pocket money and some may want to serve the 
needy, it all depends on their individual interests. So, this website connects these two people. It 
identifies a disabled person searching for a volunteer for his needs and allocates him a volunteer 
according to the availability and time provided by the volunteer at the stage of login.
The Helping Hand webpage can be viewed to the physically handicapped people by entering 
their respective user id and password. Once the user gets login, he can view the volunteer details 
by specifying the time of their need. Only the admin can add and delete the volunteer 
details . Once the volunteer details been verified he/she will be given username and password
 through which they can update their available timings accordingly.</div>
